# Alarm-Buzzer-System

In this project I was able to work directly with hardware. By using the Uno R3 starter kit I constructed a circuit connecting different components to a Arduino microcontroller which I could program to put my alarm system into motion. The alarm system is controlled via a remote control that sends signals to an infared sensor. The user can choose turn the alarm on and off as well as pick the frequency in which the buzzer sounds the alarm. The user is able to view the current speed setting of the alarm via a 7 digit segment display.
